# One Two Web3 Hackaton


[Fluence](https://fluence.network/) is excited to co-sponsor the [one two web3](https://moralis.io/filecoin-hackathon/) with a FLuence contribution of USDC 25,000.00 to make the summer of '22 count!

## About Fluence

Fluence provides the protocol, infrastructure and tools to enable decentralized compute for applications and backends on peer-to-peer networks. Fluence nodes host discoverable services comprised of WebAssembly modules, using Wasm standards to link modules and access external resources. Service discovery is achieved by p2p function addressability rather than REST or JSON-RPC. 

Control flow of service execution is abstracted out to Aqua, a Fluence's purpose-built distributed systems programming language. Aqua simplifies creation of distributed algorithms (such as orchestration, replication, consensus, parallel execution, etc) on top of distributed function calls, allowing to compose hosted services into reliable decentralized applications. As a result, the Fluence protocol and solution stack allows you to quickly and effectively create and implement Web3 protocols.

## Hacking With Fluence

Fluence is sponsoring the following named bounties:

### Track Metaverse & Gaming: Best use of Fluence to create dynamic NFT: USDC XXXX

TBD

### Track Developer tooling: Create decentralized blockchain RPC with Fluence: USDC XXXX

TBD

### Track Cloning Web2: Best AWS Lambda clone with Fluence: USDC XXXX

Fluence already allows developers to implement robust, performant and portable WASM IT business logic with Fluence's [Marine SDK]. Moreover, Fluence's  Aqua language empowers developers to compose distributed services function calls into a broader business logic. That is, Fluence already provides significant pieces to enable powerful decentralized Function as a Service (FaaS) where you can think of Wasm services as cloud functions (e.g. AWS Lambda) and Aqua scripts as workflows (e.g. AWS Step Functions or GCP Workflows).

The purpose of this bounty is to entourage teams to package Fluence's development and tooling solutions, utilizing Fluence's testnet, into an AWS Lambda clone:

* It should be able to create, deploy, and run functions (Wasm) in the Fluence network with the experience as close to Web 2 cloud functions as possible. You must use Aqua scripts to deploy and call functions on peers.
* As a bonus, it should be able to create, deploy and run workflows on top of functions as analogy to AWS Step functions, so users would be able to construct comprehensive workflows across deploying and calling functions.

### Track Doing Good: Best integration of Fluence into DAO proposals and execution: USDC XXXX

As DAOs get more prevalent and deeper and wider in their range of execution, 'code is law' at the proposal level becomes even more important. In this bounty track, we'd like to see submissions that create a (somewhat) generalized framework that attaches (compiled) Aqua workflow(s), e.g., as IPFS or Filecoin documents, as immutable compute instruction(s) to a DAO proposal and provides a mechanism to run the accepted proposal's compute, i.e. compiled Aqua script, for both on- and off-chain DAOs.
