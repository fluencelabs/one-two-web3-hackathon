# One Two Web3 Hackaton


[Fluence](https://fluence.network/) is excited to co-sponsor the [one two web3](https://moralis.io/filecoin-hackathon/) with a FLuence contribution of USDC 25,000.00 to make the summer of '22 count!

## About Fluence

Fluence provides the protocol, infrastructure and tools to enable decentralized compute for applications and backends on peer-to-peer networks. Nodes in the Fluence peer-to-peer network host discoverable services comprised of WebAssembly Interface Types (IT) modules. Resource discovery is achieved by function addressability rather than REST or JSON-RPC. Aqua, Fluence's purpose-built distributed systems programming language, allows developers to seamlessly program distributed networks and compose hosted services into decentralized applications. As a result, the Fluence protocol and solution stack allows you to quickly and effectively create and implement Web3 protocols and associated governance models within the decentralized serverless paradigm.

## Hacking With Fluence

The Fluence peer-to-peer compute protocol allows you to create decentralized off-chain protocols and applications with ease. In addition to the general pool, Fluence is sponsoring the following named bounties:



### Track Cloning Web2: Best AWS Lambda and Stepfunction packaging of Fluence and Aqua: USDC 10,000.00

Fluence already allows developers to implement robust, performant and portable WASM IT business logic with Fluence's [Marine SDK]. Moreover, Fluence's peer-to-peer Aqua language empowers developers to compose distributed services into decentralized protocols and applications. That is, Fluence already provides significant pieces to enable powerful decentralized Function as a Service (FaaS).

The purpose of this bounty is to entourage teams to package Fluence's development and tooling solutions, utilizing Fluence's testnet, in to a best-in-class AWS Lambda clone ideally with a string element of interoperability at least at the invocation level from AWS Lambda and at the tooling level. That is, 

* AWS Lambda (JS) function should be able to call Fluence Faas and yes, there will be extra points for a good project name other than Fluence Î¸ :) and
* your tooling namespaces and flags should be interoperable with AWS (Lambda) CLI as much as possible

### Track Doing Good: Best integration of Fluence and Aqua into DAO proposals and execution: USDC 10,000.00

As DAOs get more prevalent and deeper and wider in their range of execution, 'code is law' at the proposal level becomes even more important. In this bounty track, we'd like to see submissions that create a (somewhat) generalized framework that attaches (compiled) Aqua workflow(s), e.g., as IPFS or Filecoin documents, as immutable compute instruction(s) to a DAO proposal and provides a mechanism to run the accepted proposal's compute, i.e. compiled Aqua script, for both on- and off-chain DAOs.

### Any Track: Best use of Filecoin, Morialis and Fluence in a DApp or Tool: 10 x USDC 500.00
