# One Two Web3 Hackathon


[Fluence](https://fluence.network/) is excited to co-sponsor the [one two web3](https://moralis.io/filecoin-hackathon/) hackathon with a FLuence contribution of USDC 25,000.

## About Fluence

Fluence provides the protocol, infrastructure and tools to enable decentralized compute for applications and backends on peer-to-peer networks. Fluence nodes host discoverable services comprised of WebAssembly modules, using Wasm standards to link modules and access external resources. Service discovery is achieved by p2p function addressability rather than REST or JSON-RPC.

The control flow of service execution is abstracted by Aqua, Fluence's purpose-built distributed systems programming language. Aqua simplifies the creation of distributed algorithms, such as replication, consensus, parallel execution, etc., on top of distributed function calls, and also to deploy and orchestrate services on remote nodes. As a result, the Fluence protocol and solution stack allows you to quickly and effectively create and implement Web3 protocols and reliable decentralized applications.

## Hacking With Fluence

Fluence is sponsoring the following named bounties:

### Track Metaverse & Gaming USDC 3000, 2000

Example project:
Dynamic NFTs, i.e., NFTs' with mutable metadata, are an integral part of Web3 gaming and metaverse solutions. Fluence and Aqua provide the tooling and infrastructure for developers to easily create powerful, event-driven compute solutions for dynamic NFTs. Think of NFTs updating their picture or game capabilities based on off-chain events (game events, weather, crypto price, etc).

### Track Developer tooling USDC 3000, 2000

Example project:
In a time when majority of crypto depends on Infura RPC endpoints which may censor users, DApps and wallets, there is a need for a robust decentralized RPC service. Fluence and Aqua provide the tools and infrastructure to buidl decentralized multi-chain listeners and event-drivers, decentralized relays or decentralized blockchain gateway solutions that can prove to be real game changers. Think of writing an efficient load balancing algorithm in Aqua across multiple Ethereum RPC providers + Wasm adapters to those providers.

### Track Cloning Web2 USDC 3000, 2000

Example project:
Web3 DApps can't live today without centralized backends, and centralized backends are often built with using cloud functions. Fluence provides significant solution pieces to enable powerful decentralized Function as a Service (FaaS) free from vendor lock-in. You can think of Fluence Wasm services as cloud functions (e.g. AWS Lambda) and Fluence Aqua scripts as workflows (e.g. AWS Step Functions or GCP Workflows).

### Track Doing Good USDC 3000, 2000

Example project:
As DAOs play an increasingly prominent role in decentralized governance, 'code is law' plays a critical role in handling the voting on proposals and the actual resolution execution. With Fluence, you can integrate DAOs with verifiable off-chain executed code (for example embed Aqua script as IPFS CID into DAO proposals) and use it to manage the DAO app backend, re-deploy frontend, bring off-chain data, etc. Creating a framework for such an approach with Fluence and Aqua for either on or off-chain DAOs would vastly improve DAOs' operational effectiveness and autonomy.

### Any Track: Best Use of Fluence, Filecoin and Moralis, USDC: 1000 x 5
